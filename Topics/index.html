                            <p class="card-text"><br>Beginning in 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 
                                began experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.[43] In the early 1950s, 
                                there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International Geophysical 
                                Year (1957-1958). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard. After the Soviet 
                                space program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, 
                                the attention of the United States turned toward its own fledgling space efforts. The US Congress, 
                                alarmed by the perceived threat to national security and technological leadership 
                                (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. 
                                Eisenhower counseled more deliberate measures. The result was a consensus that the White House forged 
                                among key interest groups, including scientists committed to basic research; the Pentagon which had 
                                to match the Soviet military achievement; corporate America looking for new business; and a strong 
                                new trend in public opinion looking up to space exploration. <br><br>

                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">Ozone Hole Continues Shrinking in 2022:</b> <br>
                                The annual Antarctic ozone hole reached an average area of 8.9 million square miles 
                                (23.2 million square kilometers) between Sept. 7 and Oct. 13, 2022. This depleted 
                                area of the ozone layer over the South Pole was slightly smaller than last year 
                                and generally continued the overall shrinking trend of recent years. <br>
                                The ozone layer - the portion of the stratosphere that protects our planet from 
                                the Sun’s ultraviolet rays - thins to form an “ozone hole” above the South Pole every September. 
                                Chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere, 
                                derived from human-produced compounds, attach to high-altitude polar clouds each southern winter. 
                                The reactive chlorine and bromine then initiate ozone-destroying reactions as 
                                the Sun rises at the end of Antarctica’s winter. <br>
                                Researchers at NASA and NOAA detect and measure the growth and breakup of the ozone 
                                hole with instruments aboard the Aura, Suomi NPP, and NOAA-20 satellites. On Oct. 5, 2022, 
                                those satellites observed a single-day maximum ozone hole of 10.2 million square miles 
                                (26.4 million square kilometers), slightly larger than last year.

                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">Why is Sea Level Rising?:</b> <br> There's two main factors causing sea level to change. <br>
                                The first is what we call thermal expansion. So as more heat gets trapped by the atmosphere, 
                                a lot of that heat gets absorbed by the ocean. When water warms, it actually expands and that causes sea level to go up. <br>
                                The other reason that sea level is rising is because of melting ice. So we have a lot of ice contained in the ice sheets, 
                                the Antarctic, Greenland ice sheets and different mountain regions. As the Earth warms, these regions are also warming. <br>
                                So what happens is this ice melts, and when it melts, that meltwater flows into the ocean. So again, 
                                this causes sea level to go up. On regional scales, the rates of sea level rise can actually be quite different. 
                                The ocean doesn't fill like a bathtub. Different parts of the ocean see more of an effect than others, depending on two main factors. <br>
                                The first of these is something we call ocean dynamics. So as the climate changes, there can be changes in our ocean circulation, 
                                the currents, and this actually changes how water is distributed and moved about the Earth, causing sea level to be different in some locations than others. <br>
                                The other reason that we see differences in the rates from one region to the next is something we call the ice sheet fingerprints. 
                                So there's so much ice being lost from these different locations, from the ice sheets that it actually affects the gravity and rotation of the Earth. 
                                And we have these distinct, what we call fingerprints, that really dictate where the water goes when it melts. <br>
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">Robotic Navigation Tech Will Explore the Deep Ocean:</b> <br>
                                Terrain-relative navigation helped Perseverance land - and Ingenuity fly - autonomously on Mars. 
                                Now it’s time to test a similar system while exploring another frontier. Terrain-relative navigation 
                                was instrumental in helping NASA’s Mars 2020 Perseverance Mars rover make its precision touch down on 
                                the Red Planet on Feb. 18. The system allowed the descending robot to visually map the Martian landscape, 
                                identify hazards, and then choose a safe place to land without human assistance. In a similar way, 
                                the agency’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter uses a vision-based navigation system to track surface features 
                                on the ground during flight in order to estimate its movements across the Martian surface. <br>
                                Developed by engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, an evolution of 
                                the vision-based navigation that has been used on Mars will now undergo a trial run a little closer to home: 
                                off the U.S. East Coast in the Atlantic Ocean. <br>
                                orpheus which was developed on May 14 2021 is an order of magnitude lighter than most deep-sea submersibles. 
                                Smaller than a quad bike and weighing about 550 pounds (250 kilograms), Orpheus is designed to be nimble, 
                                easy to operate, and rugged while exploring depths inaccessible to most vehicles. <br>
                                Orpheus’ version of vision-based navigation is called visual-inertial odometry, or xVIO, 
                                and it works by using a system of advanced cameras and pattern-matching software along with instruments 
                                that can precisely measure its orientation and motion. As Orpheus travels over the seafloor, xVIO identifies 
                                features - such as rocks, shells, and coral - below the vehicle. Like remembering landmarks during a road trip, 
                                xVIO will construct 3D maps using these features as waypoints to help it navigate. But this system is 
                                more than simply a means to prevent the submersible robot from getting lost. <br>
                                But Klesh noted another virtue of the collaboration between NASA and organizations like WHOI and NOAA, 
                                with their extensive oceanographic expertise: The technologies being developed to explore Earth’s oceans with smart, 
                                small, and rugged autonomous underwater vehicles could ultimately be harnessed to explore the oceans on other worlds.

                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">NASA Honors Apollo Engineer:</b> <br>
                                Margaret Hamilton, leader of the team that developed the flight software for the agency's Apollo missions, 
                                has been granted a NASA Exceptional Space Act Award for her scientific and technical contributions.
                                "The Apollo flight software Ms. Hamilton and her team developed was truly a pioneering effort," 
                                said NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe. "The concepts she and her team created became the building blocks for modern 
                                'software engineering.' It's an honor to recognize Ms. Hamilton for her extraordinary contributions to NASA," he said. <br>
                                Dr. Paul Curto, senior technologist for NASA's Inventions and Contributions Board nominated Hamilton for the award. Curto said, 
                                "I was surprised to discover she was never formally recognized for her groundbreaking work. Her concepts of asynchronous software, 
                                priority scheduling, end-to-end testing, and man-in-the-loop decision capability, such as priority displays, 
                                became the foundation for ultra-reliable software design." <br>
                                One example of the value of Hamilton's software work occurred during the Apollo 11 mission. Approximately three minutes before Eagle's 
                                touchdown on the moon, the software over rode a command to switch the flight computer's priority processing to a radar system whose 
                                'on' switch had been manually activated due to a faulty written operations script provided to the crew. The action by the software 
                                permitted the mission to safely continue.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">International Space Station:</b> <br>
                                In the early 1980s, NASA planned to launch a modular space station called Freedom as a counterpart to 
                                the Soviet Salyut and Mir space stations. In 1984 the ESA was invited to participate in Space Station Freedom, 
                                and the ESA approved the Columbus laboratory by 1987.[30] The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), or Kibō, 
                                was announced in 1985, as part of the Freedom space station in response to a NASA request in 1982. <br>
                                In early 1985, science ministers from the European Space Agency (ESA) countries approved the Columbus programme, 
                                the most ambitious effort in space undertaken by that organisation at the time. In September 1993, 
                                American Vice-President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin announced plans for a new space station, 
                                which eventually became the International Space Station. They also agreed, in preparation for this new project, 
                                that the United States would be involved in the Mir programme, including American Shuttles docking, 
                                in the Shuttle-Mir programme. <br>

                                SpaceX has created reusable rocket launch systems and sent a car into space, launched satellites into 
                                orbit and now grew a partnership with NASA. That means it's the first private company to take humans 
                                into orbit and to the International Space Station. it's achieved a lot since it began in 2002 but its 
                                ultimate goal is to get humans living on other planets. SpaceX is the brainchild of Elon Musk. 
                                He helped found the company that became PayPal. he then founded Tesla an electric cars company. <br>
                                There's a lot of talk about SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and crew Dragon capsule that are being used 
                                to take American astronauts back into orbit. this launch from the Kennedy
                                Space Center in Florida on the 27th of May 2020 with 2 astronauts on board, 
                                is the first crewed mission since 2011 when NASA finally retired its space shuttle fleet. <br>
                                Reusable equipment is a big unique selling point for SpaceX. Space Exploration is cheaper if you 
                                can reuse rockets again and again. The crew dragon mission is saving NASA a lot of money some say as 
                                much as forty billion dollars

                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">July 20, 1969: One Giant Leap For Mankind:</b> <br>
                                July 1969. It's a little over eight years since the flights of Gagarin and Shepard, 
                                followed quickly by President Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon before the decade is out.<br>
                                It is only seven months since NASA's made a bold decision to send Apollo 8 all the way to the moon on 
                                the first manned flight of the massive Saturn V rocket. <br>
                                After one and a half orbits, Apollo 11 gets a "go" for what mission controllers call "Translunar Injection" 
                                - in other words, it's time to head for the moon. Three days later the crew is in lunar orbit. A day after that, 
                                Armstrong and Aldrin climb into the lunar module Eagle and begin the descent, while Collins orbits in the command module Columbia. <br>
                                Collins later writes that Eagle is "the weirdest looking contraption I have ever seen in the sky," but it will prove its worth. <br>
                                When it comes time to set Eagle down in the Sea of Tranquility, Armstrong improvises, manually piloting the ship past an area littered with boulders. 
                                During the final seconds of descent, Eagle's computer is sounding alarms. <br>
                                At 10:56 p.m. EDT Armstrong is ready to plant the first human foot on another world. With more than half a billion people watching on television, 
                                he climbs down the ladder and proclaims: "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." <br>
                                Aldrin joins him shortly, and offers a simple but powerful description of the lunar surface: "magnificent desolation." 
                                They explore the surface for two and a half hours, collecting samples and taking photographs. <br>
                                They leave behind an American flag, a patch honoring the fallen Apollo 1 crew, and a plaque on one of Eagle's legs. It reads, 
                                "Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." <br>
                                Armstrong and Aldrin blast off and dock with Collins in Columbia. Collins later says that "for the first time," 
                                he "really felt that we were going to carry this thing off." <br>
                                In a post-flight press conference, Armstrong calls the flight "a beginning of a new age," while Collins talks 
                                about future journeys to Mars. <br>

                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">Mars Pathfinder</b> <br>
                                Mars Pathfinder was launched December 4, 1996 and landed on Mars' Ares Vallis on July 4, 1997. 
                                It was designed as a technology demonstration of a new way to deliver an instrumented lander and 
                                the first-ever robotic rover to the surface of the red planet. Pathfinder not only accomplished 
                                this goal but also returned an unprecedented amount of data and outlived its primary design life. <br>
                                Both the lander and the 23-pound (10.6 kilogram) rover carried instruments for scientific observations 
                                and to provide engineering data on the new technologies being demonstrated. Included were scientific 
                                instruments to analyze the Martian atmosphere, climate, geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. <br>
                                Mars Pathfinder Science Instruments: <br>
                                Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer: Determined the elemental composition of rocks and soils.
                                Three Cameras: provided images of the surrounding terrain for geological studies, 
                                and documented the performance and operating environment for Pathfinder mission technologies. <br>
                                Atmospheric Structure Instrument/Meteorology Package: Measured the Martian atmosphere during 
                                Pathfinder's descent to the surface, and provided meteorological measurements at the lander. <br>
                                Top Mars Pathfinder Science Findings: <br>
                                Rounded pebbles and cobbles at the landing site, and other observations, suggested conglomerates 
                                that formed in running water during a warmer past in which liquid water was stable. <br>
                                Radio tracking of Mars Pathfinder provided a precise measure of the lander's location and Mars' 
                                pole of rotation. The measurements suggested that the radius of the planet's central metallic 
                                core is greater than 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) but less than roughly 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers). <br>
                                Airborne dust is magnetic, and its characteristics suggest the magnetic mineral is maghemite, a very magnetic 
                                form of iron oxide, which may have been freeze-dried on the particles as a stain or cement. An active water 
                                cycle in the past may have leached out the iron from materials in the crust. <br>
                                Dust devils were seen and frequently measured by temperature, wind and pressure sensors. 
                                Observations suggested that these gusts are a mechanism for mixing dust into the atmosphere. <br>
                                Early morning water ice clouds were seen in the lower atmosphere. <br>
                                Abrupt temperature fluctuations were recorded in the morning, suggesting that the atmosphere is 
                                warmed by the planet's surface, with heat convected upward in small eddies. <br>

                            <p class="card-text"><b class="text-primary">Perseverance and ingenuity on Mars</b> <br>
                                Perseverance, NASA's most advanced Mars rover to date, is continuing NASA’s investigation of the Red Planet. 
                                Only the fifth NASA rover destined for Mars, Perseverance is designed to build on the work and scientific 
                                discoveries of its predecessors. Joining the Perseverance rover on Mars is the first helicopter designed 
                                to fly on another planet, Ingenuity. The lightweight helicopter rode to Mars attached to the belly of the 
                                rover and will attempt up to five test flights. <br>
                                The Perseverance mission launched on July 30, 2020. After touching down on the Red Planet Feb. 18, 2021, 
                                NASA's Mars 2020 Perseverance rover will scour Jezero Crater to help us understand its geologic history 
                                and search for signs of past microbial life. But the six-wheeled robot won't be looking just at 
                                the surface of Mars: The rover will peer deep below it with a ground-penetrating radar called RIMFAX. 
                                Unlike similar instruments aboard Mars orbiters, which study the planet from space, RIMFAX will be the 
                                first ground-penetrating radar set on the surface of Mars. This will give scientists much higher-resolution 
                                data than space-borne radars can provide while focusing on the specific areas that Perseverance will explore. 
                                Taking a more focused look at this terrain will help the rover's team understand how features in Jezero 
                                Crater formed over time. Learn more about how Perseverance Rover will peer beneath Mars' surface here. <br>
                                This mission is a fantastic opportunity to engage students in real-world problem solving across the STEM fields.
